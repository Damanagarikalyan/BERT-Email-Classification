BERT, which stands for “Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers,” is an advanced natural language processing (NLP) model developed by Google.
BERT analyzes the context and relationships between words within a sentence. This contextual understanding allows it to perform exceptionally well in various NLP tasks.
BERT Email Classification Project:

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to build a spam detection model that classifies emails as either spam or not spam.
Model Details:
We utilize BERT to convert email sentences into embedding vectors. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text, enabling effective classification.
Our trained BERT model achieves impressive results, with both training and test accuracy close to 90%.
Application:
The model helps filter unwanted emails, ensuring that users receive relevant and legitimate messages while avoiding spam.
Implementation Steps:
Preprocess the email data.
Train the BERT model on labeled email examples.
Evaluate the model’s performance using test data.
Deploy the model for real-world email classification.
